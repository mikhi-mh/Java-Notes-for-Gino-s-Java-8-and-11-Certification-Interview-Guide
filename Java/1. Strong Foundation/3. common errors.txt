Common programming errors

There are two types of programming errors.
	1. Runtime errors - when the program is live and running - 
		are also called exceptions
		
	2. Compile time errors - occur before the program is run - 
		-errors that violate the rules of Java.
		-detected by the compiler we perform step and compile the program using javac
		

Some common examples
	1. This is an example of missing void keyword, 
	main method should be public static void, 
	But in this example, void is missing.
	This is a violation of Java's rules.
	--->So when we compile this program, the compiler shows below error.
	Void is basically called the return type as void is not written here.
	The compiler complains by saying return type required

	2. getting to right curly brackets here.
	The main method has its opening and closing brackets.
	here, closing bracket of the class is missing, hence compilation fails.
	
	

	3. making spelling mistakes.
	The word string of main method must start with a capital s, but here string is written in lowercase.
	So be mindful of all the spellings.
	If you misspell a word or give it a wrong casing, the program won't work.

A quick note about runtime errors.
	They are also called exceptions, 
	No matter how small the exception, once an exception occurs, it crashes the running application.
	Developers should develop applications that can withstand these runtime errors.
	If an exception occurs, the application must handle it elegantly and continue to remain running.
	A client should always be able to use the application, even if the exception occurs because of their mistake.
	Details about that ---> how to handle runtime errors and the exception handling concepts
