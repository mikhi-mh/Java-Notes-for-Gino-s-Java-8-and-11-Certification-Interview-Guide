Brief overview of the Java Platforms.(what we can do with Java.)

-James Gosling is the creator of Java.
-He was part of Sun Microsystems, the company that released the first version of Java.
-in 2009, Oracle acquired Sun. Since then, all Java updates are released by Oracle.


---There are three Java platforms.

1.	Java SE is the standard edition.
	It is a technology used for creating applications that do not require any type of server side processing.
	It is also called Core Java.
	So for running Java SE apps, we do not need to install any external software on our machine.
	They can be run directly on any computer.
	Java SE apps are also called standalone apps.


2.	Java EE stands for Java Enterprise Edition.
	Unlike Java SE, Java Enterprise Edition apps cannot be run directly on the computer.
	This is because they require a server side processing capabilities.
	This need can be fulfilled by installing special software called application server.
	A popular example of such a software is the Apache Tomcat.
	(see the difference bet app sever and server)

3.	Java ME stands for Java Micro Edition.
	It is used for creating applications for mobile devices.
	Not recommended using it 
	instead Android's Java pr kotlin or Apple's iOS' swift programming languages 


Difference server  vs app server
server(machine or hardware) - physical machine - just another pc or computer
application server (software) - not a real physical machine -  just software - it must me installed on server or machine
