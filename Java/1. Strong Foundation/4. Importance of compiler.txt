First program
	simple program which displays the message Hello.
five steps the 
	first step was to open an empty file in a text editor, 
	then create a class, let's call it welcome.
	Then create the main method inside the class, be sure to not miss a single curly bracket. The execution of the program will begin from main.
		It is called System.out.println() It uses round brackets and not curly ones.
		For convenience, this utility is popularly known as SOPLN  sysout ---> we put that text in its double quotes.
		
	save the file now ---> We give it the name of the class, which has the main method
                            So name this file as Welcome.java

The real reason why we compile programs?
	We write Java programs in English.
		-So that we, as humans can easily read it, all programming languages that are written in a human readable
		  language like English are called high level languages.
		-all applications on our computer are executed by the CPU.
		-Java Programs two are executed by CPU.

		-Java programs are written in English, but the CPU does not understand English.
		-High level language is made for humans, not for a CPU.
			The CPU has its own language.
			It only recognizes instructions that are in the form of zeros and ones.
			This is called the machine language
			
There is only one way that the CPU will be able to understand our program if we can take the program
we wrote in English and then translate it into a language that the CPU understands, only then can it
execute the program.


	-When we compile a Java program using the javac command, the compiler first checks for compile time errors.

	-If there are no errors, the compiler produces a .class file from the .java file
	This class file is called bytecode file.
	
	.class is an intermediate format between machine language and high level language.
	.class file is not in machine language.
	
	-still needs to be converted from bytecode format to machine language so that the CPU can understand
	-When we run the program using Java Command, the interpreter, also called JVM, looks for this bytecode.
	-It then converts the byte code into machine language dynamically 
	
	And that is how the CPU is then able to execute the Java program because it now has the machine language version of our program

compile our program now.
	-Open a command prompt- terminal - console.
	-type cd and then path to the folder where our program is stored.
	-move to the directory where the program has saved before we compile the program.
	- type ---> javac Welcome.java
	- Welcome.class ---> created in same folder/directory This is the bytecode file.
	- if no it means there are error--->resolve all of them and compile it till .class is generated
	---type --->   java Welcome
	message hello is printed in the console.
